It hasn't really been edited for maximum viewing/browsing pleasure for others, hence the somewhat stupid variable/file/folder names etc. I only checked there's nothing too sensitive hard coded before publishing the repository.

The actual NodeJS server code is all in the file "tsurbaserver"...

index.html and omatFileet/ folder contents contain the stuff that makes the client-side tick.

Everything mentioned so far is written by me.

Almost everything else (ShareJS and Ace being the most notable libraries) has been made by others. Information about the libraries used etc. can hopefully be found from their respective folders if needed.
