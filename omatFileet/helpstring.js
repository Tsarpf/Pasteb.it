"Share your http://pasteb.it?sOmEtHiNg style url containing a question mark (?) and you can code/write/edit/whatever in the same text\n editor concurrently with your friends and colleagues etc.\n\n" +

"By default a case-sensitive random session name is given, but you can enter whatever you want after the question mark to\n make your session's name easier to remember.\n" +
"Do realize, however, that anyone with the address can edit whatever is in the session's text editor.\n\n\n" +


"If you want something to be made uneditable forever, click the paste button to make a typical pastebin style paste and you'll\n be given a link to a read-only version of whatever was in the text editor at the time of pasting.\n\n" +

"The drop box which reads 'chrome' by default is a theme changer. If the default theme doesn't please your eyes, try an another one.\n\n" +

"Multiple syntax highlighters are available from the drop box which reads c_cpp by default. You can also change the highlighter by\n typing //NameOfLanguage on the first line of the text editor.\n\n\n" +

"You can download whatever is in the text editor by clicking the 'Download as file' button.\n" +
"pastes (read-onlys) also have the Raw button which shows you the contents of the text editor in a pure text form without the pasteb.it\n logo and syntax highlighting etc.\n\n\n\n" +
